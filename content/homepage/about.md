## Hey, I am Junaid

I am currently a sophomore at [KIIT, Bhubaneshwar](https://kiit.ac.in/) studying Computer Science and Engineering. I currently head the Web Team at [DSC KIIT](https://dsckiit.tech/). I also help run [Weekly Research Newsletter - KIIT](http://weekly.researchnewsletter.ml/).

Computers and Math have fascinated me since I was a little kid. I started programming when I was 13 and eventually became extremely curious and passionate about computing. Most of my experience has been with full stack web technologies with a little bit of machine learning and deep learning. You can have a look at most of my work on my github. 

I mostly workout or do some stock trading in my free time. I read a lot, mostly about psychology, society, tech, design and economics. I love to learn new things and build something cool. 


## Skills and Interests

* **Languages**: Python, Javascript, C/C++, Golang
* **Frameworks**: React, PyTorch, Scikit-learn, Pandas, Flask, Echo, NodeJS, Typescript
* **Other**: Git, Linux, SQL, CI/CD, Docker, MS Azure, AWS, Firebase, Latex

My prime interest lies in the intersection of systems engineering and machine learning. I really enjoy learning about system architecture and deploying
ML/DL models at scale.

## Projects

Here are some of the key projects I have worked on in the past few months

* [**Divert - DSCKIIT's URL Redirection Service**](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT/divert)
  * Developed the internal URL redirect service, handling over 1k redirects at peak load. Improved latency and throughput using hashmaps, caching and multi-threading

* [**Semen Motility Analysis Using 3D CNNs**](https://gitlab.com/innerve/sperm-motility-analysis)
  * Semen analysis is an integral part of Invitro Fertilization also known as IVF. We trained a spatial temporal 3D convolutional neural network to predict sperm motility from videos along with other tabular data.
  * *Runner Up, Innerve Data Hackathon, 2020 Organised by IGDTUW*

* [**HalideOS**](https://github.com/DSC-KIIT/project-halide)
  * An Experimental OS written entirely from scratch.
  * It supports a basic shell with some commands including a command line calculator. You can boot it up in virtual box.


* [**Plothole - AI powered Pothole Reporting**](https://github.com/teambitflip/plothole) 
  * Developed an end to end AI powered pothole reporting system. Photos of potholes clicked by citizens are classified by CNNâ€™s (VGG-16) to determine validity and severity.
  * *Submitted for Smart India Hackathon, 2020.*

Most of my other projects are open sourced under the MIT license and available on my [github](https://www.github.com/junaidrahim)


## Publications

* [Predicting Semen Motility using three-dimensional Convolutional Neural Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.02888)


### YouTube

Just some of the videos I put out, most of them are tutorials or sessions I conduct online for DSC KIIT.

* [Session 2 : Building Video Chat Apps using WebRTC and Golang](https://youtu.be/JTIm3ChI-6w)
* [Building our Internal URL Redirect Service - Divert | Dev Vlog](https://youtu.be/xH6F806CvQc)
* [Learn C - The fun way](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLT-AS3Wcy-pkPo1ECXgh1QZCor7CwqQDw)

### What am I reading these days ?

Currently I am reading **The Battle for Beloning** by **Shashi Tharoor**. It's about looking at nationalism in a meta way and noticing how the meaning of nationalism has changed so much in the recent times esp with the rise of populism in democracies all across the world.

I kinda maintain a to-be-read list [here](https://www.notion.so/jhr/Reading-List-04bdaadef0cf424e9a6212af1270e0e5). If you're really curious :)
